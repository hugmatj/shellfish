# Shellfish Developer Tools

These are developer tools for the Shellfish library. These tools require
Node.js (https://nodejs.org).

Run
```
npm install
```
in the tools directory first in order to install the additional dependencies.

**Note:** You do not require Node.js to use Shellfish. This requirement is only
for working with the Developer Tools.

## make-bundle.js

Creates bundle packages for use with Shellfish's module loader.

Run
```
node make-bundle.js -h
```
for up-to-date usage details.
